# Prompticorn ðŸ¦„

Example prompt that is probably good enough for an image:

```
A blue, ancient dragon knitting a red scarf with a cross stitch pattern, sitting cross legged in a lush forest. The light strikes at the golden hour of sunrise with birds starting to rise.
```

## Techstack

This is a [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) project using app router and Vercels [ai sdk](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/introduction). For UI components we use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

# Interesting places in the code

- Check if Prompt from user is an image prompt: [Check if Image Prompt](app/api/chat/checkIfImagePrompt.ts)
- LLM logic without any framework: [backend route](app/api/chat/route.ts)
- Look at a backend response to see markers.
- Parse chat messages on the frontend: [Bot Chat Message](app/chat/[chatId]/BotChatMessage.tsx)
